## ðŸ’¡ Project Introduction

**RedPine** is an intelligent customer support platform composed of two major components:

* **Backend**: Where core business logic, document management, and the fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model are built and served through microservices.

* **Frontend**: A simple React + Vite web interface providing a user-friendly chat interaction with the RAG Core Service.

The **RAG Core Service** specifically utilizes **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** principles to combine the strengths of information retrieval and large language model (LLM) generation.

This service enhances traditional AI chatbot capabilities by ensuring:

* Faster and more accurate responses

* Contextually grounded answers based on real company documents

* Reduced hallucination and misinformation from the model

Built with **FastAPI** and a fine-tuned **FLAN-T5 model**, it seamlessly integrates with the RedPine API Gateway and Docstore services.

## ðŸ”— How It Works

1. **User Query Input:**
    - A customer sends a question to the API Gateway frontend.

2. **Retrieval Phase:**
    - Relevant document chunks are retrieved from the Docstore's indexed knowledge base (future roadmap).

3. **Generation Phase:**
    - The fine-tuned FLAN-T5 model generates a customized, context-aware response.

4. **Response Delivery:**
    - The API Gateway delivers the generated answer back to the frontend client.
